# QuizApp

A simple MEAN stack-based Quiz App. Definitions made to run the app on localhost.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Also, to ensure app works right, you have to start the API server by going to the 'api' folder and running 'node app.js' from within. Also, ensure that database connection string is accordingly updated in the config files.
